perfecto
========

Wordpress plugin that allows to hover and move image on top of a page. It's good for comparing design and current HTML/CSS

Currently it has no admin panel where you could upload images. So for now upload them manually to /wp-content/uploads/perfecto/

After that hover your mouse to top right corner of your site.

Have fun!
